# image-classifier-neural-networks
 Neural Networks for Classification  In this notebook we are going to explore the use of Neural Networks for image classification. We are going to use a dataset of small images of clothes and accessories, the Fashion MNIST. You can find more information regarding the dataset here: https://pravarmahajan.github.io/fashion/  Each instance in the dataset consist of an image, in a format similar to the digit images you have seen in the previous homework, and a label. The labels correspond to the type of clothing, as follows:  | Label | Description | | --- | --- | | 0 | T-shirt/top | | 1 | Trouser | | 2 | Pullover | | 3 | Dress | | 4 | Coat | | 5 | Sandal | | 6 | Shirt | | 7 | Sneaker | | 8 | Bag | | 9 | Ankle boot |
